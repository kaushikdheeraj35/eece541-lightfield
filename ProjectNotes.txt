Project:
1. Convert the images to YUV format.
2. Sequence them (row by row or spiral).
3. Task 1: Explore and evaluate (try to implement) the compression methods discussed in the paper.
4. Task 2: Implement multi-view: Think about spatial and temporal for 3D view.
5. Task 3: Subjective and objective evaluation methods.

For the proposal:
1. Show your understanding of lightfields. Be prepared for questions.
2. Explain what the project is gonna be. Show differences between camare array and microlens arrays.

Proposal presentation feedback:
1. HEVC is lossy. This project hence focuses on evaluation of lossy compression schemes.
2. Think about how to visualize/display light fields (for subjective evaluation).
3. Multi-views. How many views can we have?
4. How many subapertures are there in a given camera? (Cannot change as it is a physical property of the camera.)

1. Convert from RGB to YCbCr
2. Chroma-downsampling (for 444 -> 420 only)
3. Make a YUV (video) (Note: For MVC, may need to separate columns and rows)
4. Use HEVC (the 5 methods in the paper) and with MVC (multi-view coding) to compress the YUV (try different configurations)
5. Evaluation

Tips and notes:
1. Should probably use a GOP of 4 to keep things relatively simple.
2. Think about how to set up reference frames for spiral (just the one at the centre?) and line (say every 17 frams?).
3. When experimenting with intermediate results, can try downsampling the images when making videos to reduce the data to process.
