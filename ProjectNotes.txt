Project:
1. Convert the images to YUV format.
2. Sequence them (row by row or spiral).
3. Task 1: Explore and evaluate (try to implement) the compression methods discussed in the paper.
4. Task 2: Implement multi-view: Think about spatial and temporal for 3D view.
5. Task 3: Subjective and objective evaluation methods.

For the proposal:
1. Show your understanding of lightfields. Be prepared for questions.
2. Explain what the project is gonna be. Show differences between camare array and microlens arrays.

Proposal presentation feedback:
1. HEVC is lossy. This project hence focuses on evaluation of lossy compression schemes.
2. Think about how to visualize/display light fields (for subjective evaluation).
3. Multi-views. How many views can we have?
4. How many subapertures are there in a given camera? (Cannot change as it is a physical property of the camera.)

1. Convert from RGB to YCbCr
2. Chroma-downsampling (for 444 -> 420 only)
3. Make a YUV (video) (Note: For MVC, may need to separate columns and rows)
    3.1. Other than the raster scan and spiral patterns, may get creative and try other patterns such as back-and-forth raster (S-shaped) or spiral-in.
4. Use HEVC (the 5 methods in the paper) and with MVC (multi-view coding) to compress the YUV (try different configurations)
    4.1 For the compression schemes in the paper, skip the metadata and 4DLF parts as we're using camera arrays not lenselet images.
    4.2 Get the MVC paper from Joseph.
    4.3 Try to reproduce the results in the paper.
    4.4 Try to do better than those?
5. Evaluation

Tips and notes:
1. Should probably use a GOP of 4 to keep things relatively simple at the beginning.
    1.1 Optimize the GOP structure For 17x17 camera array images (should probably use a GOP of 17?)
2. Can try playing with the QP factor in the config (get the QP presets from Joseph?)
3. Think about how to set up reference frames for spiral (just the one at the centre?) and line (say every 17 frames?).
4. When experimenting with intermediate results, can try downsizing the images when making videos to reduce the data to process.

Usage:
1. Run the MATLAB script: `project.m` to generate the videos
2. Navigate to the `assets` directory. Run:
```
    TAppEncoder.exe -c config_good.cfg -i sequence_line.yuv -b str_line.bin -o rec_line.yuv
    TAppEncoder.exe -c config_good.cfg -i sequence_spiral.yuv -b str_spiral.bin -o rec_spiral.yuv
```

Single-view HEVC:
1. Raster
2. Spiral
MVC:
1. Row-wise sequencing
2. Another one

Common:
1. Resolution 1024 -> 256; chroma: 444 -> 420
2. Resolution 1024; chroma: 444 -> 420
3. Resolution 1024: chroma: 444

Each five QPs and three GOP sizes.
=> 2 * 3 * 5 * 3 = 90 data points
Single-view and MVC combined gives 180 data points.
Remember to do subjective tests (invite people that are not involved) and document the process.
Ask Joseph to evaluate them first!
